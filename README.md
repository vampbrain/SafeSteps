### AI-Powered Safety Navigation for Female Solo Travelers

> **Transforming urban mobility through intelligent crime-aware routing**

SafeSteps leverages spatial crime analysis and risk modeling to provide safety-first navigation recommendations, specifically designed to empower female solo travelers with confidence and security.

---

## üéØ **Problem Statement**

**60% of women** avoid certain routes due to safety concerns, limiting their mobility and independence. Traditional navigation apps prioritize speed and distance but ignore critical safety factors, leaving vulnerable travelers without essential risk information.

**The Challenge**: How can we provide intelligent route recommendations that balance efficiency with personal safety?

---

## üí° **Our Solution**

SafeSteps analyzes crime patterns and risk factors to deliver **safety-scored route alternatives** with intelligent recommendations that prioritize user security without sacrificing convenience.

### **Core Innovation**
- **Crime-Aware Routing**: Spatial risk assessment using real crime statistics
- **Multi-Route Analysis**: Compares all Google Maps alternatives with safety scores
- **Emergency Integration**: SOS functionality with auto-contact alerts
- **Time-Sensitive Intelligence**: Adjusts risk based on travel timing

## üöÄ **How It Works**

### **Phase 1: App Initialization & Route Discovery**
```
App Launch ‚Üí Get User Location ‚Üí Set Current Location as Start Point
User Input ‚Üí Geocoding ‚Üí Route Fetching ‚Üí Data Extraction ‚Üí Visual Display
```

1. **Location Setup**: App requests permissions and gets user's current GPS coordinates
2. **Destination Input**: User enters target address in search field
3. **Address Geocoding**: Google Geocoding API converts addresses to coordinates and validates locations within city bounds
4. **Route Fetching**: Google Directions API returns multiple route alternatives with polylines, distances, and durations
5. **Initial Display**: All routes displayed in **blue color** with start (green) and end (red) markers

### **Phase 2: Spatial Risk Analysis**
```
Route Data ‚Üí Crime Pattern Analysis ‚Üí Risk Calculation ‚Üí Safety Scoring
```

1. **Data Preparation**: Structures route coordinates, distances, and metadata for analysis
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-05-23T...",
    "total_routes": 3,
    "routes": [
        {
            "route_id": "route_0",
            "summary": "NH 4",
            "distance_value": 15200,
            "duration_value": 1380,
            "coordinates": [
                {"latitude": 13.0827, "longitude": 80.2707}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

2. **Spatial Risk Calculation**: Analyzes each route coordinate against crime hotspot database using distance-weighted scoring
3. **Time-Based Adjustment**: Applies temporal multipliers based on travel timing
4. **Route Scoring**: Assigns safety scores (0-10 scale) with risk categories: LOW ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí MEDIUM-HIGH ‚Üí HIGH

### **Phase 3: Visual Route Highlighting**
```
Risk Analysis ‚Üí Route Ranking ‚Üí Color Update ‚Üí User Feedback
```

- **Selected Route**: **Green color**, thicker line (width: 6)
- **Alternative Routes**: **Blue color**, thinner lines (width: 4)
- **Status Updates**: "‚úì Safest Route Selected" with route summary showing distance and duration

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Mobile**: Flutter cross-platform application
- **Backend**: Flask API with spatial analysis algorithms
- **Data**: Karnataka crime statistics with synthetic modeling
- **Integration**: Google Maps API (Geocoding, Directions, Maps SDK)
- **Analysis**: Distance-based spatial risk modeling with temporal patterns

### **Key Components**
1. **Spatial Risk Engine**: Processes synthetic crime data from official statistics using distance-weighted algorithms
2. **Route Safety Scorer**: 0-10 scale with percentile-based risk categories
3. **Emergency Response System**: One-tap SOS with contact automation
4. **Mobile-First Interface**: Intuitive design for quick decision-making

### **Risk Calculation Method**
```python
def calculate_route_safety(route_coordinates, travel_time):
    route_risks = []
    for point in route_coordinates:
        # Distance-weighted crime impact
        base_risk = calculate_spatial_risk(lat, lon, crime_hotspots)
        # Time-based adjustment
        adjusted_risk = apply_temporal_multiplier(base_risk, travel_time)
        route_risks.append(adjusted_risk)
    
    # Conservative approach: use maximum risk point
    max_risk = max(route_risks)
    safety_category = categorize_risk(max_risk)  # Percentile-based
    return safety_score, safety_category
```
