# SafeSteps 🛡️
### AI-Powered Safety Navigation for Female Solo Travelers

> **Transforming urban mobility through intelligent crime-aware routing**

SafeSteps leverages machine learning and crime pattern analysis to provide safety-first navigation recommendations, specifically designed to empower female solo travelers with confidence and security.

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**60% of women** avoid certain routes due to safety concerns, limiting their mobility and independence. Traditional navigation apps prioritize speed and distance but ignore critical safety factors, leaving vulnerable travelers without essential risk information.

**The Challenge**: How can we provide intelligent route recommendations that balance efficiency with personal safety?

---

## 💡 **Our Solution**

SafeSteps analyzes crime patterns and risk factors to deliver **safety-scored route alternatives** with intelligent recommendations that prioritize user security without sacrificing convenience.

### **Core Innovation**
- **Crime-Aware Routing**: ML-powered risk assessment using crime statistics
- **Multi-Route Analysis**: Compares all Google Maps alternatives with safety scores
- **Emergency Integration**: SOS functionality with auto-contact alerts
- **Time-Sensitive Intelligence**: Adjusts risk based on travel timing

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Phase 1: Route Discovery**
```
User Input → Geocoding → Route Fetching → Data Extraction → Visual Display
```

1. **Location Setup**: App gets user's current GPS coordinates and sets as start point
2. **Destination Input**: User enters target address
3. **Route Fetching**: Google Directions API returns multiple route alternatives with polylines, distances, and durations
4. **Initial Display**: All routes shown in grey with start (green) and end (red) markers

### **Phase 2: ML-Powered Route Selection**
```
Route Data → ML Processing → Route Selection → Visual Update
```

1. **Data Preparation**: Structures route coordinates, distances, and metadata for ML analysis
2. **Safety Analysis**: ML model processes crime patterns, traffic data, and risk factors
3. **Route Scoring**: Assigns safety scores (0-10 scale) with risk categories: LOW → MEDIUM → MEDIUM-HIGH → HIGH
4. **Selection**: Recommends safest route with confidence score and reasoning

### **Phase 3: Visual Route Highlighting**
```
ML Response → Route Identification → Color Update → User Feedback
```

- **Selected Route**: Green color, thicker line (width: 6)
- **Alternative Routes**: Grey color, thinner lines (width: 4)
- **Status Updates**: "✓ ML Route Selected" with route summary
